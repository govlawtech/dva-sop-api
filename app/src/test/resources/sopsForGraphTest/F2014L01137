Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role\nobligations at work, school, or home.\nF. Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or\ninterpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol.\nG. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or\nreduced because of alcohol use.\nH. Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.\nI. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or\nrecurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been\ncaused or exacerbated by alcohol.\nJ. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:\n(i) a need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve\nintoxication or desired effect; or\n(ii) a markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same\namount of alcohol.\nK. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following:\n(i) the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol; or\n(ii) alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine)\nis taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.\nThe definition of alcohol use disorder excludes acute alcohol intoxication in\nthe absence of alcohol use disorder"
