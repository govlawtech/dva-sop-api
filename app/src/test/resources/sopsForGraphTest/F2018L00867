The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a\r\nsubstance or another medical condition.\r\nNote 1: Criteria A–C constitute a major depressive episode. Major depressive episodes are common in\r\nbipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.\r\nNote 2: bipolar I disorder and DSM-5 are also defined in the Schedule 1 - Dictionary.\r\nmajor depressive episode with mixed features meets the following\r\ndiagnostic criteria (derived from DSM-5):\r\nA.

Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from\r\nthe person's usual behaviour.\r\nC. For individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria for either mania or\r\nhypomania, the diagnosis should be bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.\r\nD. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of\r\na substance (for example, a drug of abuse, a medication or other\r\ntreatment).\r\nNote: DSM-5 and major depressive episode are also defined in the Schedule 1 - Dictionary.\r\nmanic episode meets the following diagnostic criteria (derived from\r\nDSM-5):\r\nA. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or\r\nirritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or\r\nenergy, lasting at least one week and present most of the day, nearly\r\nevery day (or any duration if hospitalisation is necessary).\r\nB. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or\r\nactivity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is\r\nonly irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a\r\nnoticeable change from usual behaviour:\r\n(i) inflated self-esteem or grandiosity;\r\n(ii) decreased need for sleep (for example, feels rested after only\r\nthree hours of sleep);\r\n(iii) more talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking;\r\n(iv) flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing;\r\n(v) distractibility (that is, attention too easily drawn to unimportant\r\nor irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed;\r\n(vi) increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or\r\nschool, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (that is, purposeless\r\nnon-goal-directed activity); or\r\n(vii) excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for\r\npainful consequences (for example, engaging in unrestrained\r\nbuying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business\r\ninvestments).\r\nC. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked\r\nimpairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate\r\nhospitalisation to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic\r\nfeatures.\r\nD. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a\r\nsubstance (for example, a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment)\r\nor another medical condition.\r\nNote 1: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (for example, medication,\r\nelectroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological\r\neffect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and, therefore, a bipolar I\r\ndiagnosis.\r\nNote 2: Criteria A–D constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic episode is required for the\r\ndiagnosis of bipolar I disorder.\r\nNote 3: bipolar I disorder and DSM-5 are also defined in the Schedule 1 - Dictionary."

Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the\r\nsame two-week period and represent a change from previous\r\nfunctioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (i) depressed mood\r\nor (ii) loss of interest or pleasure:\r\nNote: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition.\r\n(i) depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated\r\nby either subjective report (for example, feels sad, empty, or\r\nhopeless) or observation made by others (for example, appears\r\ntearful);\r\nNote: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.\r\n(ii) markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all,\r\nactivities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either\r\nsubjective account or observation);\r\n(iii) significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (for\r\nexample, a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month),\r\nor decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day;\r\nNote: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.\r\n(iv) insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day;\r\n(v) psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day\r\n(observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of\r\nrestlessness or being slowed down);\r\n(vi) fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day;\r\n(vii) feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt\r\n(which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-\r\nreproach or guilt about being sick);\r\n(viii) diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness,\r\nnearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by\r\nothers); or\r\n(ix) recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent\r\nsuicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a\r\nspecific plan for committing suicide.\r\nB. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in\r\nsocial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\r\nC. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a\r\nsubstance or another medical condition.\r\nNote 1: Criteria A–C constitute a major depressive episode. Major depressive episodes are common in\r\nbipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.\r\nNote 2: bipolar I disorder and DSM-5 are also defined in the Schedule 1 - Dictionary.\r\nmajor depressive episode with mixed features meets the following\r\ndiagnostic criteria (derived from DSM-5):\r\nA. At least three of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms are present\r\nduring the majority of days of a major depressive episode:\r\n(i) elevated, expansive mood;\r\n(ii) inflated self-esteem or grandiosity;\r\n(iii) more talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking;\r\n(iv) flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing;\r\n(v) increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at\r\nwork or school, or sexually);\r\n(vi) increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high\r\npotential for painful consequences (for example, engaging in\r\nunrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, foolish business\r\ninvestments); or\r\n(vii) decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than\r\nusual, to be contrasted with insomnia).\r\nB. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from\r\nthe person's usual behaviour.\r\nC. For individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria for either mania or\r\nhypomania, the diagnosis should be bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.\r\nD. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of\r\na substance (for example, a drug of abuse, a medication or other\r\ntreatment).\r\nNote: DSM-5 and major depressive episode are also defined in the Schedule 1 - Dictionary.\r\nmanic episode meets the following diagnostic criteria (derived from\r\nDSM-5):\r\nA. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or\r\nirritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or\r\nenergy, lasting at least one week and present most of the day, nearly\r\nevery day (or any duration if hospitalisation is necessary).\r\nB. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or\r\nactivity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is\r\nonly irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a\r\nnoticeable change from usual behaviour:\r\n(i) inflated self-esteem or grandiosity;\r\n(ii) decreased need for sleep (for example, feels rested after only\r\nthree hours of sleep);\r\n(iii) more talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking;\r\n(iv) flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing;\r\n(v) distractibility (that is, attention too easily drawn to unimportant\r\nor irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed;\r\n(vi) increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or\r\nschool, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (that is, purposeless\r\nnon-goal-directed activity); or\r\n(vii) excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for\r\npainful consequences (for example, engaging in unrestrained\r\nbuying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business\r\ninvestments).\r\nC. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked\r\nimpairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate\r\nhospitalisation to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic\r\nfeatures.\r\nD. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a\r\nsubstance (for example, a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment)\r\nor another medical condition.\r\nNote 1: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (for example, medication,\r\nelectroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological\r\neffect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and, therefore, a bipolar I\r\ndiagnosis.\r\nNote 2: Criteria A–D constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic episode is required for the\r\ndiagnosis of bipolar I disorder.\r\nNote 3: bipolar I disorder and DSM-5 are also defined in the Schedule 1 - Dictionary."
