Statement of Principles
concerning
LUMBAR SPONDYLOSIS
No. 63 of 2014
for the purposes of the
Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986
and
Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004
Title
1. This Instrument may be cited as Statement of Principles concerning lumbar
spondylosis No. 63 of 2014.
Determination
2. The Repatriation Medical Authority under subsection 196B(3) and (8) of the
Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 (the VEA):
(a) revokes Instrument No. 38 of 2005, as amended by Instrument No. 79
of 2008, Instrument No. 37 of 2010 and Instrument No. 70 of 2013,
concerning lumbar spondylosis; and
(b) determines in their place this Statement of Principles.
Kind of injury, disease or death
3. (a) This Statement of Principles is about lumbar spondylosis and death
from lumbar spondylosis.
(b) For the purposes of this Statement of Principles, "lumbar
spondylosis" means a degenerative joint disorder affecting the lumbar
vertebrae or intervertebral discs with:
(i) clinical manifestations of local pain and stiffness, or symptoms and
signs of lumbar cord, cauda equina or lumbosacral nerve root
compression; and
(ii) imaging evidence of degenerative change, including disc space
narrowing or osteophytes.
Other commonly associated features include facet joint arthritis, bone
hypertrophy and spinal stenosis. This definition excludes diffuse
idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, Scheuermann’s kyphosis and bulging
of an intervertebral disc in the absence of other signs of disc
degeneration. Lumbar spondylosis includes spondylosis at the
lumbosacral junction.
(c) Lumbar spondylosis attracts ICD-10-AM code M47.16, M47.17,
M47.26, M47.27, M47.86, M47.87, M47.96, M47.97 or M51.3.
(d) In the application of this Statement of Principles, the definition of
"lumbar spondylosis" is that given at paragraph 3(b) above.
Basis for determining the factors
4. On the sound medical-scientific evidence available, the Repatriation Medical
Authority is of the view that it is more probable than not that lumbar
spondylosis and death from lumbar spondylosis can be related to relevant
service rendered by veterans or members of the Forces under the VEA, or
members under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 (the
MRCA).
Factors that must be related to service
5. Subject to clause 7, at least one of the factors set out in clause 6 must be
related to the relevant service rendered by the person.
Factors
6. The factor that must exist before it can be said that, on the balance of
probabilities, lumbar spondylosis or death from lumbar spondylosis is
connected with the circumstances of a person’s relevant service is:
(a) having inflammatory joint disease in the lumbar spine before the
clinical onset of lumbar spondylosis; or
(b) having an infection of the affected joint as specified at least one year
before the clinical onset of lumbar spondylosis; or
(c) having an intra-articular fracture of the lumbar spine at least one year
before the clinical onset of lumbar spondylosis; or
(d) having a specified spinal condition affecting the lumbar spine for at
least the one year before the clinical onset of lumbar spondylosis; or
(e) having leg length inequality for at least the five years before the clinical
onset of lumbar spondylosis; or
(f) having a depositional joint disease in the lumbar spine before the
clinical onset of lumbar spondylosis; or
(g) having trauma to the lumbar spine at least one year before the clinical
onset of lumbar spondylosis, and where the trauma to the lumbar spine
occurred within the 25 years before the clinical onset of lumbar
spondylosis; or
(h) having a lumbar intervertebral disc prolapse before the clinical onset of
lumbar spondylosis at the level of the intervertebral disc prolapse; or
(i) lifting loads of at least 35 kilograms while bearing weight through the
lumbar spine to a cumulative total of at least 168 000 kilograms within
any ten year period before the clinical onset of lumbar spondylosis, and
where the clinical onset of lumbar spondylosis occurs within the 25
years following that period; or
(j) carrying loads of at least 35 kilograms while bearing weight through
the lumbar spine to a cumulative total of at least 3 800 hours within
any ten year period before the clinical onset of lumbar spondylosis, and
where the clinical onset of lumbar spondylosis occurs within the 25
years following that period; or
(k) being obese for at least ten years within the 25 years before the clinical
onset of lumbar spondylosis; or

clinical worsening of lumbar spondylosis; or

before the clinical worsening of lumbar spondylosis; or

least the one year before the clinical worsening of lumbar spondylosis;
or
(t) having leg length inequality for at least the five years before the clinical
worsening of lumbar spondylosis; or
(u) having a depositional joint disease in the lumbar spine before the
clinical worsening of lumbar spondylosis; or
(v) having trauma to the lumbar spine at least one year before the clinical
worsening of lumbar spondylosis, and where the trauma to the lumbar
spine occurred within the 25 years before the clinical worsening of
lumbar spondylosis; or
(w) having a lumbar intervertebral disc prolapse before the clinical
worsening of lumbar spondylosis at the level of the intervertebral disc
prolapse; or
(x) lifting loads of at least 35 kilograms while bearing weight through the
lumbar spine to a cumulative total of at least 168 000 kilograms within
any ten year period before the clinical worsening of lumbar
spondylosis, and where the clinical worsening of lumbar spondylosis
occurs within the 25 years following that period; or
(y) carrying loads of at least 35 kilograms while bearing weight through
the lumbar spine to a cumulative total of at least 3 800 hours within

spondylosis.
Factors that apply only to material contribution or aggravation
7. Paragraphs 6(p) to (ee) apply only to material contribution to, or aggravation
of, lumbar spondylosis where the person’s lumbar spondylosis was suffered or
contracted before or during (but not arising out of) the person’s relevant
service.

includes an injury or disease in respect of which there is a Statement of
Principles then the factors in that last mentioned Statement of Principles apply
in accordance with the terms of that Statement of Principles as in force from
time to time.
