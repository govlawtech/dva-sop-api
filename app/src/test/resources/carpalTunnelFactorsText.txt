The factor that must as a minimum exist before it can be said that a reasonable
hypothesis has been raised connecting carpal tunnel syndrome or death
from carpal tunnel syndrome with the circumstances of a person's relevant
service is:
(a) performing any combination of repetitive activities or forceful
activities with the affected hand for at least 130 hours within a period
of 120 consecutive days before the clinical onset of carpal tunnel
syndrome, and where the repetitive or forceful activities have not
ceased more than 30 days before the clinical onset of carpal tunnel
syndrome; or
(b) daily self-propulsion of a manual wheelchair for at least a cumulative
period of 130 hours within a period of 120 consecutive days before the
clinical onset of carpal tunnel syndrome, and where the self-propulsion
of a manual wheelchair has not ceased more than 30 days before the
clinical onset of carpal tunnel syndrome; or
(c) performing activities where the affected hand or forearm is directly
vibrated for at least 130 hours within a period of 120 consecutive days
before the clinical onset of carpal tunnel syndrome, and where those
activities have not ceased more than 30 days before the clinical onset of
carpal tunnel syndrome; or
(d) having an injury to the affected wrist or hand which does not involve a
fracture or a dislocation but which:
(i) alters the normal contour of the carpal tunnel; or
(ii) damages the flexor tendons within the carpal tunnel,
within the one year before the clinical onset of carpal tunnel syndrome;
or
(e) having a fracture or dislocation to the distal radius, the distal ulna, a
carpal bone or a metacarpal bone of the affected side which:

metacarpal joint of the thumb at the time of the clinical onset of carpal

(u) being treated with an aromatase inhibitor within the six months before
the clinical onset of carpal tunnel syndrome; or
(v) being pregnant within the three months before the clinical onset of
carpal tunnel syndrome; or
(w) performing any combination of repetitive activities or forceful
activities with the affected hand for at least 130 hours within a period
of 120 consecutive days before the clinical worsening of carpal tunnel
syndrome, and where the repetitive or forceful activities have not
ceased more than 30 days before the clinical worsening of carpal tunnel
syndrome; or
(x) daily self-propulsion of a manual wheelchair for at least a cumulative
period of 130 hours within a period of 120 consecutive days before the
clinical worsening of carpal tunnel syndrome, and where the self-
propulsion of a manual wheelchair has not ceased more than 30 days
before the clinical worsening of carpal tunnel syndrome; or
(y) performing activities where the affected hand or forearm is directly
vibrated for at least 130 hours within a period of 120 consecutive days
before the clinical worsening of carpal tunnel syndrome, and where
those activities have not ceased more than 30 days before the clinical
worsening of carpal tunnel syndrome; or
(z) having an injury to the affected wrist or hand which does not involve a

within the one year before the clinical worsening of carpal tunnel
syndrome; or

before the clinical worsening of carpal tunnel syndrome; or
(bb) having surgery to the affected wrist or hand which:
(i) alters the normal contour of the carpal tunnel; or
