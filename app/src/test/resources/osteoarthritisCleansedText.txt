Statement of Principles
concerning
OSTEOARTHRITIS
No. 13 of 2010
for the purposes of the
Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986
and
Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004
Title
1. This Instrument may be cited as Statement of Principles concerning
osteoarthritis No. 13 of 2010.
Determination
2. The Repatriation Medical Authority under subsection 196B(2) and (8) of
the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 (the VEA):
(a) revokes Instrument No. 31 of 2005 concerning osteoarthrosis; and
(b) determines in its place this Statement of Principles.
Kind of injury, disease or death
3. (a) This Statement of Principles is about osteoarthritis and death
from osteoarthritis.
(b) For the purposes of this Statement of Principles, "osteoarthritis"
means a degenerative joint disorder with:
(i) clinical manifestations of pain, impaired function and
stiffness; and
(ii) radiological, other imaging or arthroscopic evidence of loss
of articular cartilage or osteophytes.
Other commonly associated features are sclerosis of the
underlying bone, inflammation of the synovium and, for
osteoarthritis in the knee, degenerative tears of the menisci. This
definition excludes acute traumatic chondral defect and
osteochondritis dissecans.
(c) Osteoarthritis attracts ICD-10-AM code M15, M16, M17, M18 or
M19.
(d) In the application of this Statement of Principles, the definition of
"osteoarthritis" is that given at paragraph 3(b) above.
Basis for determining the factors
4. The Repatriation Medical Authority is of the view that there is sound
medical-scientific evidence that indicates that osteoarthritis and death
from osteoarthritis can be related to relevant service rendered by
veterans, members of Peacekeeping Forces, or members of the Forces
under the VEA, or members under the Military Rehabilitation and
Compensation Act 2004 (the MRCA).
Factors that must be related to service
5. Subject to clause 7, at least one of the factors set out in clause 6 must be
related to the relevant service rendered by the person.
Factors
6. The factor that must as a minimum exist before it can be said that a
reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting osteoarthritis or
death from osteoarthritis with the circumstances of a person’s relevant
service is:
(a) being a prisoner of war before the clinical onset of osteoarthritis;
or
(b) having inflammatory joint disease of the affected joint before the
clinical onset of osteoarthritis in that joint; or
(c) having an infection of the affected joint as specified before the
clinical onset of osteoarthritis in that joint; or
