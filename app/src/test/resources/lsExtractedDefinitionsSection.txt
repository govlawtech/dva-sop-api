For the purposes of this Statement of Principles:
"a depositional joint disease" means gout, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate
deposition disease (also known as pseudogout), haemochromatosis, Wilson’s
disease or alkaptonuria (also known as ochronosis);
"a kyphotic abnormality" means abnormally increased dorsal convexity in
the curvature of the lumbar vertebral column;
"a lordotic abnormality" means abnormally increased dorsal concavity in the
curvature of the lumbar vertebral column;
"a specified spinal condition" means:
(a) a deformity of a joint of a vertebra;
(b) a deformity of a vertebra;
(c) a kyphotic abnormality;
(d) a lordotic abnormality;
(e) necrosis of bone;
(f) retrospondylolisthesis;
(g) scoliosis; or
(h) spondylolisthesis;
"an infection of the affected joint as specified" means bacterial or fungal
infection of the affected joint in the lumbar spine resulting in inflammation
within that joint;
"an intra-articular fracture" means a fracture involving any articular surface
of the affected joint;
"being obese" means an increase in body weight by way of fat accumulation
which results in a Body Mass Index (BMI) of thirty or greater.
The BMI = W/H
2
 and where:
W is the person’s weight in kilograms; and
H is the person’s height in metres;
"death from lumbar spondylosis" in relation to a person includes death from
a terminal event or condition that was contributed to by the person’s lumbar
spondylosis;
"extreme forward flexion of the lumbar spine" means being in a posture
involving greater than 90 degrees of trunk flexion;
"G force" means the ratio of the applied acceleration of the aircraft to the
acceleration due to gravity, for example, 4G = 4 x 9.81m/s
2
;
"ICD-10-AM code" means a number assigned to a particular kind of injury or
disease in The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
Health Problems, 10th Revision, Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM),
Eighth Edition, effective date of 1 July 2013, copyrighted by the Independent
Hospital Pricing Authority, and having ISBN 978-1-74128-213-9;
"inflammatory joint disease" means rheumatoid arthritis, reactive arthritis,
psoriatic arthropathy, ankylosing spondylitis, or arthritis associated with
Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis;
"leg length inequality" means a clinically significant disparity of at least
three percent or three centimetres in leg length, whichever is the lesser, where
the inequality remains uncorrected and involves the limb in daily use;
"lifting loads" means manually raising an object;
"relevant service" means:
(a) operational service under the VEA;
(b) peacekeeping service under the VEA;
(c) hazardous service under the VEA;
(d) British nuclear test defence service under the VEA;
(e) warlike service under the MRCA; or
(f) non-warlike service under the MRCA;
"terminal event" means the proximate or ultimate cause of death and
includes:
(a) pneumonia;
(b) respiratory failure;
(c) cardiac arrest;
(d) circulatory failure; or
(e) cessation of brain function;
"trauma to the lumbar spine" means a discrete event involving the
application of significant physical force, including G force, to the lumbar spine
that causes the development within twenty-four hours of the injury being
sustained, of symptoms and signs of pain and tenderness and either altered
mobility or range of movement of the lumbar spine. In the case of sustained
unconsciousness or the masking of pain by analgesic medication, these
symptoms and signs must appear on return to consciousness or the withdrawal
of the analgesic medication. These symptoms and signs must last for a period
of at least seven days following their onset; save for where medical
intervention has occurred and that medical intervention involves either:
(a) immobilisation of the lumbar spine by splinting, or similar external
agent;
(b) injection of corticosteroids or local anaesthetics into the lumbar spine; or
(c) surgery to the lumbar spine.
